# Westlake APC's Submission to GitHub Game Off 2016

![GitHub Game Off 2016 Theme is Hacking, Modding, or Augmenting](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/121322/19498019/d8827370-9543-11e6-82d8-6da822b6147b.png)

## Our Submission

We have the entire month of November to create a game *loosely* based on the theme **hacking, modding and/or augmenting**.

We chose to make a game focusing around _modding_'s second unofficial meaning: moderation. In the game, you control a federally commissioned team to _moderate_ the behavior of bad guys working for the CIA to lower their sentences, in an insanely large and chaotic rendition of _White Collar_, the bad guys being a user-controlled SpriteKit particle effect.

## How to build

To build our app on a macOS 10.12 environment with Xcode 8 and Cocoapods, first install the Cocoapods dependencies.

```bash
pod install
```

Then, use the `xcrun` command line tool as follows, to compile and run:

```bash
xcrun xcodebuild \
  -scheme iOS \
  -workspace GameOff.xcworkspace \
  -configuration Debug \
  -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 7 Plus,OS=10.0'
```
