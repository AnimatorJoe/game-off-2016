# Immolation Organization

![GitHub Game Off 2016 Theme is Hacking, Modding, or Augmenting](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/121322/19498019/d8827370-9543-11e6-82d8-6da822b6147b.png)

## Our Submission

We are the Westlake Accessible Programming Club, a team of high-schoolers interested in the development of everything from games to kernels in the high-level language Swift. We're excited this year to take the entire month of November to create a game *loosely* based on the theme **hacking, modding and/or augmenting** for the developer services company GitHub's annual game development competition, the Game Off.

In our submission, you control a federally commissioned team to _**moderate**_ a cluster of bad guys working for the CIA to lower their sentences, which _**hack**_ away at evil robots and aliens, the bad guys being a user-controlled SpriteKit particle effect. Pretty much, it's just an insanely enormous and chaotic rendition of DC Comics' _Suicide Squad_.

## How to build

To build our app on a macOS 10.12 environment with Xcode 8 and Cocoapods, first install the Cocoapods dependencies.

```bash
pod install
```

Then, use the `xcrun` command line tool as follows, to compile an intermediate binary:

```bash
xcrun xcodebuild \
  -scheme iOS \
  -workspace GameOff.xcworkspace \
  -configuration Debug \
  -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 7 Plus,OS=10.0'
```

Then, just launch Simulator and run _Immolation Organization_.

## How to play

In _Immolation Organization_, you moderate a mob of baddies with the intent of hacking away at and destroying alien spacecrafts! You do so by pointing at and touching places for the mob to travel. They'll always deteriorate and diminish the spacecrafts, but depending on who's bigger, the mob or the spacecrafts, they will either enlarge or shrink.
